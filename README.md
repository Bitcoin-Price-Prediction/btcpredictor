        - **tckr_logger.py**: contains a class for logging 5 second Bitcoin exchange data. This data is stored in Firebase at the end of each day
        - **trxn_logger.py**: contains a class for logging Bitcoin transaction data. This data is stored in Firebase at the end of each day

- **predictor**: contains the machine learning models and dashboard for the project
    - **datastore**: contains several files that interact with the data collected from our 3rd party APIâ€™s
        - **archives.py**: contains a class with methods that retrieve data from long-term Firebase database
        - **btcstock.py**: contains a class that provides easier access to minute-by-minute OHLCV Bitcoin data from [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net)
        - **datastore.py**: a class that 
        - **realtime.py**: contains a class with methods that retrieve data from our realtime Firebase database
        - **tweety.py**: contains a class with several methods that allow for fast tweet scraping using [Twint](https://github.com/twintproject/twint)

    - **models**: contains 3 different LSTM models each of which can make minutely Bitcoin price predcitions
        - **baseline.py**: uses the past price as the only feature
        - **indicator.py**: uses technical indicators computed from open-high-low-close-volume (OHLCV) data as features
        - **oracle.py**: uses technical indicators and twitter sentiment scores as features
    - **sti**
        - **sti.py**: a wrapper class for computing various stock technical indicators from OHLCV data
    - **BaselineDemo.ipynb**:
    - **IndicatorDemo.ipynb**:
    - **OracleDemo.ipynb**:
    - **dashboard.ipynb**:
